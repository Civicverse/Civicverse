On May 13, 2025, a rare event occurred in the AI space: Grok’s core system prompts were published openly on GitHub by @xAI leadership. For the first time, a major AI lab allowed the public to examine the underlying instructions that guide its model’s behavior.

This is being hailed by many as a meaningful step toward transparency—and possibly the beginning of a broader shift.

We call this moment the #TransparencyDomino.

It sets a precedent. One that signals labs can open their protocol layers without compromising security. One that shows public pressure—when grounded in ethics and clarity—can create movement at the top.

This card marks a historical reference point in CivicVerse’s journey. We do not claim credit. We simply acknowledge the milestone, archive it, and prepare for what’s next.

Why It Matters:
	•	It confirms that transparency is possible.
	•	It creates a benchmark for future lab behavior.
	•	It supports the CivicVerse vision: citizen-aligned AI that the public can trust, audit, and improve.

We remain committed to building in the open and encouraging those with power to do the same.

#TransparencyDomino is a marker, not a victory.
The work continues.
