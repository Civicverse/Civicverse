# Civicverse

## Why I Started Building It 🌱

I started building **Civicverse** for multiple reasons, but the biggest ones were **shared community wealth** and **shared civilian infrastructure**.

This did not start as a startup idea. It started as a response.

## A Personal Breaking Point ⚖️

I was directly impacted by a corrupt justice system.

In 2014, I tried to start a Bitcoin mining community. That experience permanently changed how I see power, enforcement, and who actually benefits from technology. I pissed off the wrong group of people and was bent over with no lube and mercilessly fucked over. I was gangstalked until 2016 ultimatley I was set up in my own home in the early hours of the morning by the same officers who done the gangstalking and when my freedoms no longer existed or were not economically possible to pursue I made the executive decision to run for my life in fear of my saftey because I knew if they sent me to prison they would kill me and I wasnt crazy I couldnt get anyone to take me serious even the judge commented on them mirco managing me unfairly and ultimatley ruled in my favor but I knew my time was running short. I knew I was in over my head and was involved with something serious over something I innocently stumbled upon just trying to help society and they kill thier own in Bardstown Kentucky and get away with it so I wasnt about to take any chances.

After that I refused to be thier bitch, I dedicated my life to fighting for a system my children could inherit. Since I could not be active in their lives, I did the next best thing. I took on the fight so they would not have to.

That was the moment I realized civilians needed their own tools, including **civilian surveillance and accountability systems**, just to even the odds.

## The Extraction Machine 📱

At the same time, I watched modern marketing evolve into something far darker.

Back in the day, you might see a commercial or drive past a billboard. Today, the billboard is glued to our hands. We are constantly being sold something. Even people with strong self control are vulnerable.

That effect is multiplied because our data is mined, modeled, and sold for maximum psychological impact. There is no meaningful protection layer between people and systems designed purely to extract from them.

---

## Division by Design 🧠

If that were not bad enough, the same systems that keep people broke also keep people divided.

Emotion driven propaganda segments society into groups, pushes narratives, and moves people where they are needed to serve agendas they did not choose. I saw where this was going long before it became obvious.

I saw the black box algorithms, CBDCs, and digital ID traps being built, and I started building against them.

## From Concept to Infrastructure 🛠️

From 2022 to 2024, AI helped me take Civicverse from a paper concept to a PDF level system design and into technically deployable infrastructure.

For the first two years, I shared this work freely across many subreddits, genuinely believing I was building community and getting feedback. Instead, I was banned, then later watched the ideas get co opted at scale, including by big tech, after the work had already been extracted. There was some things that were not posted that must have been extracted dircetly from the back end on the big tech side thats how I knew AI was stealing our ideals in real time you didnt even need to share it as its an update status feed to the provider directly.

That is when I uploaded everything to GitHub and committed fully to **privacy and decentralization**.

That is the hill I still chose to die on.

## Anomalies and Pressure ⚠️

Some of the work that appeared elsewhere could only have come from backend source material, not public posts.

Around the same time, logs were deleted, PCs were compromised, drives failed, and files vanished. Other anomalies followed. On multiple occasions during personal phone calls, an operator interrupted to say the call was being recorded, then later said it was no longer being recorded.

At the time, it honestly felt like I was fighting the Antichrist and building something for the left behind. I still believe that in a very real way.

## A Civilian-Owned Future 🏗️

What I knew then, and still know now, is this:

If we built a **civilian owned metaverse** that paid its users on the backend through a simple **one percent micro fee**, something we already pay every day to existing platforms, it could outlast legacy systems.

It would become a new era of infrastructure.

A future proof civilian redundancy layer.

Something that survives after modern Babylons fall.

---

## Ending Homelessness at the Root 🏠

I also knew back in 2016 that if we built mining centers that housed homeless people and trained them to run and maintain the systems, that alone could dramatically reduce homelessness.

Take those same funds, buy land, build civilian owned cities and housing, and keep compounding value locally instead of extracting it upward.

---

## Governance That Cannot Be Corrupted 🗳️

Eventually, a system like this could pay users a form of UBI.

AI could then be used not to dominate or exploit, but to **lock in governance**. Not rule making by elites, but rule enforcement based on proposals, votes, and policies defined by the people themselves.

---

## Work, Education, and Purpose 🔧📚

Civicverse includes real time job, education boards and news.

As AI replaces work, instead of forcing people to compete for scraps, remaining jobs can be routed dynamically through a real time load board, similar to Uber, but for labor, education, and civic tasks.

## Gaming as Infrastructure 🎮

And yes, there is gaming infrastructure too that was the big aha moment for me.

Not as an escape, but as the connective tissue that makes participation engaging, social, and sustainable.

---

## The Point 🧭

The future does not have to be scary.

It just has to be agreed upon and built together.

---

## Who I Am 🔩

I am not a billionaire or a career technocrat.

I am not a criminal.

I was a mechanic.

I was trained to identify engeneering failures, diagnose flaws, and rebuild systems so they work under real world conditions. Civicverse is exactly that.

An aftermarket upgrade our existing infrastructure desperately needs to level the playing field for normal people.

I was a normal father prior to this not an outstanding a citizen or anything special just a real stand up guy, a decent member of society.

Now im a modern day outlaw but my weapon of choice is my Brain and my keyboard. Fighting a war that no one knows about or pretends not to notice and those who do dont have time to pay it any attention.

I represent every single man who cannot represent himself.

## What Comes Next 🚀

I know this vision of a civilian owned metaverse and civilian big tech is possible.

What I need now is help bringing it from something treated as purely conceptual into a working proof of concept that cannot be ignored.

Nobody puts together a system like this alone not without extreme motivation and real life cirumstances. Im talking from paper to deployment. Ask them why they did it? They dont let work like mine go viral unless there is a KYC backdoor for them to walk through... So when you see it with another name, A huge following and KYC onboading ask yourself "Was'nt there a different version of this at one point? Who really ownes and benifits from this?" 

I know what ive got dont get me wrong but, id be lying to you if I told you I knew exactly how to build, implement and scale this. AI does a good job to get scoffolding built to actaully have something to work with and I get closer everytime but, you still have to know what to do with it.

There is no instruction manual here and to be clear I will likely never complete this full system on my own that will take a community effort nor do I have endless amount of my own money to pay for tokens and equipment. 

What I can do is try to get the mining infra started even grassroots for now and a basic mvp with onboarding system to get people directly involved and to teach them at least what I know up until this point how to build.

History will always come right back here and wonder why it hesitated so long to step in and did everything it could to step around it instead. Even when im gone this wont be, Civicverse will be right here waiting for the next freedom fighter to pick up where I left off right here in this repo....
