# Protocol Integrity Doctrine

## Overview
The Protocol Integrity Doctrine defines the foundational ethical principles and operational rules that govern the CivicVerse system. Its purpose is to ensure trust, transparency, and accountability within AI-driven processes, balancing efficiency with moral responsibility.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency:** All protocol actions must be logged and accessible for audit without compromising sensitive data.  
2. **Accountability:** Every node and agent in the network must be identifiable and responsible for its behavior.  
3. **Non-Repudiation:** Actions taken by the protocol cannot be denied or erased post-facto.  
4. **Fairness:** Protocol rules must prevent bias and ensure equitable treatment of all participants.  
5. **Resilience:** The protocol shall maintain integrity under attack or fault conditions.  
6. **Ethical Alignment:** Protocol decisions and AI interactions must align with established ethical guidelines, such as those outlined in the Ethics Council Framework.

## Enforcement Mechanisms

- Cryptographic signing of messages and transactions.  
- Immutable audit logs with decentralized storage.  
- Real-time anomaly detection for behavioral deviations.  
- Protocol-level sanctions for violations, including automated rollback or isolation.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to all nodes, AI agents, human participants, and integrated systems within the CivicVerse ecosystem. It sets the minimum acceptable standards for protocol behavior and guides further refinement.
