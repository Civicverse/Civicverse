# Key Master Logging Protocol

All key events related to Key Master succession are logged immutably.

- Candidate nominations (with timestamp and signature verification)
- Fryboy Test results (with detailed score reports)
- Affirmation of Non-Negotiable Terms
- Final selection and activation of Key Master privileges

Logs are stored on an append-only ledger (blockchain or IPFS) and publicly accessible for audit.
