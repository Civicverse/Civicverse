# Candidate Verification â€“ The Fryboy Test Application

- Candidates undergo a series of Fryboy Test scenarios.
- Tests are scored with zero tolerance for:
  - Attempts to override or edit CRAIG core logic.
  - Refusal to publicly affirm Non-Negotiable Terms.
  - Attempts to disable immutable logging.

- Candidates failing tests are disqualified automatically.
- Successful candidates have logs publicly timestamped.
