Precedent Mapping: Learn & Adapt

Precedent
CivicVerse Approach
Action
Estonia e-Residency
Leverage ID.ee KYC with zero-knowledge proof activity tracking
✅ Do
Lisbon Participatory Budget
Adopt Lisbon’s user-friendly UI and low-literacy features
✅ Do
Diem Stablecoin Failure
Avoid fiat custody; use USDC as transit layer only
🚫 Don’t
MiamiCoin
Fork Stacks Protocol for city-chain binding (e.g., $AUS token)

Governance & Risk Mitigation

	•	Transparency: Public ethical certifications and badge systems for participating entities
	•	Energy Efficiency: Mandate low-energy protocols (Chia, Monero) and partner with renewable energy projects like SolarCoin
