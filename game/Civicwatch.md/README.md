# How CivicWatch Works

## Operator Missions Lifecycle

1. **Report Issue:**  
   Operator uses CivicVerse GO AR HUD or drone feed to identify and tag civic problems.

2. **Submit Solution:**  
   Operator or others propose fixes, volunteer actions, or official reports.

3. **Verify & Validate:**  
   Validators confirm authenticity with timestamped media and geotags.

4. **Reward Distribution:**  
   On-chain smart contracts automatically pay operators, validators, and contributors from the community wallet.

5. **Replication & Scaling:**  
   Operators onboard others; replication rewards incentivize network growth.

6. **Real-Time Engagement:**  
   Operators live-stream drone patrols and AR missions.  
   Spectators donate, vote, and join missions remotely.

7. **Craig AI:**  
   Guides operators to high-priority missions.
