How CivicWatch Works
1. Operator Missions Lifecycle
Report Issue: Operator uses CivicVerse GO AR HUD or drone feed to identify and tag civic problems.

Submit Solution: Operator or others propose fixes, volunteer actions, or official reports.

Verify & Validate: Validators confirm authenticity with timestamped media and geotags.

Reward Distribution: On-chain smart contracts automatically pay operators, validators, and contributors from the community wallet.

Replication & Scaling: Operators onboard others; replication rewards incentivize network growth.

2. Real-Time Engagement
Operators live-stream drone patrols and AR missions.

Spectators donate, vote, and join missions remotely.

Craig AI guides operators to high-priority missions.

Payout & Reward Flow
Mining Pool Rewards:

Mining nodes generate crypto rewards (Monero, Kaspa, BTC, ETH).

A portion is reserved for CivicWatch mission payouts.

Microtax Contributions:

1% microtax on all CivicVerse transactions funnels into community wallets supporting CivicWatch.

Mission Completion Rewards:

Operators earn base payouts for verified problem reports.

Additional bounties for solutions and verifications.

Validator pools receive staking rewards for confirming mission authenticity.

Donations & Tips:

Spectators and community members can donate to specific missions or Operators.

Automatic Distribution:

Smart contracts handle transparent and tamper-proof payout distribution.

Validators and Operators can track payments through UI dashboards and blockchain explorers.

Getting Started
Clone the repo and install dependencies for backend and frontend.

Start backend API and AI assistant services.

Run frontend apps for Operator and Spectator modes.

Deploy smart contracts on Ethereum or testnet for payout management.

Join local mesh network for offline mission support.

Summary
CivicWatch is a complex decentralized app (dApp) connecting real-world civic action with blockchain incentives, AI assistance, and community governance. Its modular repo structure supports fast iteration and scale across desktop, mobile, and mesh environments.
