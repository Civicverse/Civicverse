# 🛰️ How CivicWatch Works

CivicWatch transforms civic action into a gamified, blockchain-backed, AI-powered system of real-world missions and rewards. Operators are everyday citizens who take on verified community tasks using drones, AR, and mobile devices—all while earning crypto and building local resilience.

---

## 🎮 Operator Missions Lifecycle

**📍 Report Issue**  
Operators use the CivicWatch AR HUD or drone feeds to identify and tag civic problems (e.g., damage, hazards, crimes, outages).

**🛠️ Submit Solution**  
Operators or community members propose fixes, actions, or reports.

**✅ Verify & Validate**  
Validators confirm authenticity using timestamped photos, videos, and geotags.

**💸 Reward Distribution**  
Smart contracts automatically pay Operators, Validators, and Contributors from the community wallet.

**🔁 Replication & Scaling**  
Operators earn replication bonuses for onboarding new participants.

**📡 Real-Time Engagement**  
Operators live-stream missions. Spectators can donate, vote, or join remotely.

**🧠 Craig AI**  
CivicVerse's AI assistant guides Operators to high-priority missions and suggests actions.
