Systemic Immunity Against Recursive Abuse

‚∏ª

üõ°Ô∏è What is the Loop Recovery Protocol?

The Loop Recovery Protocol is CivicVerse‚Äôs built-in immune system. It identifies and intervenes when a system begins looping ‚Äî protecting power or suppressing truth through recursion, consensus capture, or institutional gaslighting. It is designed to detect abuse, trigger rollback or override, and restore ethical alignment using verified civic truth.

When voting loops, manipulation patterns, or abuse of reputation systems are detected, the protocol acts immediately ‚Äî freezing actors, restoring consensus, or triggering a FryboyOverride, which resets the system to a verified, ethical baseline.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Technical Breakdown)

1. Loop Detection Module
Watches for voting loops, recursive flags, consensus traps, or abuse patterns. Uses behavior logs and CivicHash snapshots.

2. Integrity Check Engine
Verifies against CivicOS Baseline Truth, off-chain civic evidence, or historical hashes.

3. Recovery Trigger Handler
Rolls back to a clean state, freezes abusers, or overrides corrupted consensus with hardcoded truth.

4. Execution Engine
Executes recovery actions: rollback, freeze, reweight, or trigger FryboyOverride.

5. Audit & Log Layer
Publicly records all events, flags, actions, and truth reassertions to a civic audit log or decentralized archive.

‚úÖ What It Does
	‚Ä¢	Detects when a system is recursively failing or being gamed
	‚Ä¢	Freezes manipulation (reputation abuse, gaslighting, consensus traps)
	‚Ä¢	Verifies against known civic truths and hash snapshots
	‚Ä¢	Overrides broken consensus to restore ethical integrity
	‚Ä¢	Publishes tamper-proof logs of every action taken

It ensures CivicVerse cannot be captured by the very systems it is designed to replace. It is the final defense against corruption loops, manipulation cycles, and institutional denial.

üß† Final Summary

The Loop Recovery Protocol is more than a failsafe ‚Äî it‚Äôs the covenant that truth is not negotiable. When institutions fail, nodes get compromised, or power games spiral into recursive decay, the protocol steps in. It is CivicVerse‚Äôs anti-corruption immune system, truth firewall, and ethical self-correction layer.

This cannot be gamed.
It cannot be bought.
It cannot be bypassed.

It is the loopbreaker.

CivicVerse lives because the truth has a recovery protocol.
