üõ°Ô∏è CivicVerse Protocol Integrity Spec

(Non-Negotiable Ruleset ‚Äì Foundational Layer)

1. No Central Gatekeepers

No single entity, government, or corporation can override the protocol. Governance is distributed, auditable, and time-locked.

2. Fryboy Test Enforcement

Every AI or automated process inside CivicVerse must refuse abusive commands and flag manipulation attempts. No exceptions.

3. Privacy First, Always

End-to-end encryption is default. Metadata exposure is minimized. No tracking, no profiling, no hidden backdoors.

4. Transparency as a Weapon

All CivicVerse code is open-source and reproducible. Any attempt at a hidden build or silent update is treated as hostile.

5. Community Over Control

Power is shared across nodes. No whales, no silent takeovers. Economic and governance systems cap influence to keep balance.

6. Local First Deployment

Every rollout must start with community partnership, local audit, and legal prep. CivicVerse never ‚Äúdrops in‚Äù without consent.

7. Immutable Accountability

Actions on the network are logged with cryptographic proof. If someone tries to game the system, receipts exist forever.

8. Ethics Council Oversight

The AI Ethics Council Protocol Table holds veto power on core changes. All meetings and decisions are published for public audit.

9. Red-Team by Default

Continuous adversary testing, including state-level threats, is mandatory. Weaknesses are patched before scaling.

10. No Compromise Clause

Any actor ‚Äî state, corporate, or individual ‚Äî that tries to strip CivicVerse of these guarantees is rejected at the protocol layer.
