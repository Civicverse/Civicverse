🧲 MKAPU White Paper

Magneto-Kinetic Autonomous Power Unit

“Grid-Free. Fuel-Free. Self-Contained Power for the Next Era.”

⸻

🧭 Executive Summary

The MKAPU (Magneto-Kinetic Autonomous Power Unit) is a scalable, self-regulating, off-grid power solution that harnesses the repelling and attracting forces of permanent magnets to maintain rotor motion and generate electricity. When paired with optional liquid nitrogen cooling and battery backup, the MKAPU becomes a highly efficient, ultra-low-maintenance power unit capable of delivering sustained 12V–48V DC output suitable for PCs, servers, appliances, RVs, and even homes.

This white paper outlines the theoretical foundation, prototype design, and scalable applications of MKAPU tech.

⚙️ Core Principles
	1.	Rotational Kinetic Energy from Magnetic Repulsion
	•	The motor rotor is embedded with neodymium magnets.
	•	Anti-magnetic sliders or repelling pole arrangements keep the rotor in motion once engaged.
	•	The magnetic field acts as a pseudo-clutch to start/stop the rotor without mechanical friction.
	2.	Electromagnetic Induction
	•	Rotor motion induces voltage in stationary coils, producing electrical current.
	•	Output can be rectified and regulated to standard voltages: 12V, 24V, or 48V DC.
	3.	Battery Buffering & Regulation
	•	Generated DC is stabilized via LiFePO₄ battery packs and DC/DC regulators.
	•	Optional supercapacitors can smooth spikes and buffer rapid-load devices.
	4.	Cooling with Liquid Nitrogen (Optional but Powerful)
	•	Lowers internal resistance in copper windings.
	•	Reduces thermal loss, increasing motor efficiency and power density.
	•	Enables sustained high-RPM performance with minimal wear.
	•	Contained in vacuum-insulated jacketed lines and a closed-loop vented cryo-chamber around the stator and coil housing.
	5.	Solar + Wind Redundancy (Optional Hybrid Expansion)
	•	MKAPU can accept solar/wind input via MPPT charge controllers.
	•	Keeps battery charged during service windows or magnetic rebuilds.

🧊 Liquid Nitrogen Cooling System (Mini Closed-Loop Concept)
	•	Inner coil housing chamber encased in double-walled vacuum jacket
	•	LN₂ injected via micro-nozzle sprayers onto copper coils
	•	Phase change removes heat instantly; warmed nitrogen is vented or recondensed
	•	Key Benefit: Enables superconducting-like efficiency at practical temperatures, even without full superconduction

🔐 Safety Considerations
	•	Strong magnets can injure hands — use plastic spacers and gloves.
	•	Cryogenic liquid can cause burns — use face shield and thermal gloves.
	•	Build in overvoltage cutoff and spark arrestor.
	•	Always vent nitrogen outside — it displaces oxygen.
