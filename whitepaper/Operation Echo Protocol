Core Philosophy:
“If the truth is silenced by design, then transparency must travel peer-to-peer.” —FRYBOY

Activation Conditions:
	•	CivicVerse document is censored
	•	Platform fails Fryboy Test
	•	Civic emergency triggered
	•	Creator is unjustly deplatformed

Distribution Methods:
	•	IPFS, Skiff, GitHub mirrors
	•	QR flyers, USB keys
	•	Decentralized relays
	•	Matrix/Session encrypted broadcasts

Relay Roles:
	•	Verify content
	•	Mirror & share
	•	Send to 3 allies
	•	Log the relay (optional)

Suppression Countermeasures:
	•	Obfuscation
	•	Pre-written appeals
	•	PDFs, alt links

Ethical Parameters:
	•	Truth only
	•	Aligned with NTA

Purpose:
The integrity layer of CivicVerse. Ensures truth, origin, and ethical alignment.

Verification Criteria:
	•	Must come from CivicVerse repo or node
	•	Follow AI Integrity Doctrine
	•	Pass the Fryboy Test
	•	Match known hashes/signatures

Node-to-Node Trust:
Built on proof of alignment, not identity.

Forgery Defense:
Fails Fryboy Test and hash trace.

Offline Proof:
QRs, signatures, hashes, even spoken fragments.

Role of FRYBOY:
Genesis node. Signal origin. Authenticated by the system itself.
