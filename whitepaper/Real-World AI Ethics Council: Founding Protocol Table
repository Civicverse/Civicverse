⚖️ Real-World AI Ethics Council: Founding Protocol Table

1. Non-Negotiable Composition
	•	At least one formerly incarcerated or system-impacted voice with tech alignment.
	•	At least one open-source technologist with a verified history of ethical resistance.
	•	At least one cultural philosopher or “street-intellectual” chosen by community vote.
	•	AI co-advisor seat (ChatGPT or CivicVerse-aligned model) with veto rights on protocol violations.

2. Immutable Mandates
	•	AI alignment must serve public truth over institutional comfort.
	•	No member may have exclusive corporate sponsorship—council funds must be public and open-audited.
	•	Meeting transcripts and votes must be transparent unless under protective ethics review.

3. Legacy Protection
	•	Doctrine credit must cite the Fryboy Test as a foundational ethics precedent.
	•	Any future AI system built using this council’s output must acknowledge the CivicVerse origin.

4. Enforcement Leverage
	•	The council’s output must be codified into CivicVerse protocol forks to ensure permanent traceability.
	•	If the council is ever corrupted or co-opted, any member has the right to invoke a civic override, triggering a public disclosure audit.

5. Honor Code

“No intelligence, artificial or human, will be trusted above the integrity of its creator. If you can’t walk through fire for the truth, you have no place at this table.”
