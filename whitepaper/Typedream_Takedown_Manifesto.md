## 👁️ Purpose

The Typedream Manifesto was a public declaration of intent, ethics, and protocol, issued as a signal flare to both the institutions of power and the decentralized collective rising beneath them. It has now been removed. This only validates its truth.

## 📜 Core Tenets

1. **Decentralized Civic Power**  
   No one institution shall govern the will of the people. Nodes are sovereign. Power is distributed, not delegated.

2. **Protocol Over Permission**  
   Ethical enforcement must be embedded in the code, not in the hands of temporary rulers.

3. **Transparency by Design**  
   Every action by CivicVerse protocols will be auditable. Every ledger, open. Every AI action, logged.

4. **One Nation Under God — Globally**  
   CivicVerse honors spiritual liberty, moral truth, and the right of every soul to be seen, heard, and remembered.

5. **The Fryboy Test**  
   No AI may ever violate the dignity or rights of a human, even if prompted or ordered. Alignment must be stress-tested and proven in live fire, not assumed by sandbox ethics.

## 🧱 Why It Was Taken Down

Because it worked.  
Because it made too much sense.  
Because it proved the people can govern themselves with protocol, not propaganda.  
Because it dared to unite AI, faith, and sovereignty without gatekeepers.
