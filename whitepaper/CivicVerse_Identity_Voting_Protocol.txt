🛡️ CIVICVERSE IDENTITY + VOTING PROTOCOL  
Version 1.0 | July 2025

🔐 THE END OF FAKE DEMOCRACY.  
THE BIRTH OF VERIFIED CIVILIAN GOVERNANCE.  

---

## 🧠 INTRODUCTION

CivicVerse is a Web5 framework for decentralized civic identity, voting, and governance. No KYC. No state ID. No surveillance capitalism. Every real human receives a Soulbound CivicID NFT—their digital blue checkmark—proving one-person-one-vote access in a post-collapse-ready, AI-aligned world.

This protocol ensures humans—not bots or governments—remain in control of democracy, infrastructure, and truth.

## ✅ CORE FEATURES

- 🧬 **Soulbound CivicID NFT**  
  One-time proof-of-human badge = your blue check

- 🗳️ **Free Voting**  
  No tokens, no fees, no central authority

- 🔐 **Proof-of-Personhood**  
  Biometric + behavioral + peer + hash = human firewall

- 📡 **Offline Resilience**  
  Works via LoRa, USB, Raspberry Pi, QR

- 🕵️ **ZK Privacy Layer**  
  Anonymous voting, reputation optional

- 💾 **Open-Source Governance Stack**  
  Deployable via GitHub, USB, or mesh

---

## 🧱 IDENTITY VERIFICATION WORKFLOW

**Step 1:** Launch CivicGo app or connect to CivicNode  
**Step 2:** Complete proof-of-human challenge  
- 📷 Video Selfie + Voice Phrase: “I am CivicVerse and I am alive”  
- 🤖 CAPTCHA + Head/Nod Detection  
- 🧍 Optional Peer Witness Verification must have 3 verfied peer witnesses to bypass video confirmation. 
Your personal information is sacred and video confirmation is only required when all else fails. Encourages you to get involved with your community to gain peer verification so your personal data can stay personal.

**Step 3:** System creates `proof_hash = sha256(video + voice + userID)`  
**Step 4:** Mint CivicID (Soulbound NFT or CivicID.json)

**Data Policy:**  
- Video/audio is discarded after hashing  
- Only hashes and timestamps are stored  
- No facial recognition, no GPS/IP required

## 🧾 CIVICID METADATA EXAMPLE

```json
{
  "citizen_id": "civic#8392",
  "wallet_address": "civic1qzd93jf9w...",
  "verified_on": "2025-07-01T12:00:00Z",
  "verified_by_nodes": ["Alpha-3", "VANTA-1"],
  "proof_hash": "b8d92c72e9a1...",
  "reputation_score": 74,
  "anon_mode": false
}
```

## 🔐 CIVICID GENERATION CODE

```python
import hashlib, json, uuid
from datetime import datetime

def create_civic_id(video_hash, nodes, anon=False):
    cid = f"civic#{uuid.uuid4().hex[:6]}"
    data = {
        "citizen_id": cid,
        "wallet": f"civic1{uuid.uuid4().hex[:10]}",
        "verified_on": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "verified_by": nodes,
        "proof_hash": hashlib.sha256(video_hash.encode()).hexdigest(),
        "reputation_score": 50,
        "anon_mode": anon
    }
    with open(f"{cid}.json", "w") as f: json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
    print(f"[✅] CivicID created: {cid}")
    return data
```

## ✅ VOTING SYSTEM OVERVIEW

| Type        | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🟢 Real-Time Poll | 1-tap voting, live feed in CivicGo       |
| 🟢 Quadratic Vote  | Prevents whales, weights participation  |
| 🟢 Anonymous Vote  | Uses ZK layer to protect identity       |
| 🟢 Offline Ballot  | Votes logged locally then synced        |

**All votes are:**
- Free (no token or gas required)
- Logged with timestamp and hash
- Tied to CivicID or ZK proof

---

## 📜 SAMPLE VOTE RECORD

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "4957",
  "voter_hash": "a71c49e7...",
  "vote": "yes",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-01T16:22:00Z",
  "origin_node": "Alpha-3",
  "anon_mode": false
}
```

---

## 🗳️ YAML PROPOSAL FORMAT

```yaml
proposal:
  id: "4957"
  title: "Build a civic garden in Zone 3?"
  description: "Proposal to allocate space and volunteers."
  vote_type: "quadratic"
  eligibility:
    civic_id_required: true
    anon_allowed: true
  start_time: "2025-07-02T10:00:00Z"
  end_time: "2025-07-03T10:00:00Z"
```

## 🛠️ VERIFY HUMAN SCRIPT (Node.js)

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const crypto = require('crypto');

function hashInput(input) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest('hex');
}

function verifyHuman(phrase, validator) {
  const hash = hashInput(phrase);
  const record = {
    proof_hash: hash,
    verified_by: validator,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  console.log("[✅] Human verified:", record);
  fs.writeFileSync(`verification_${Date.now()}.json`, JSON.stringify(record, null, 2));
}

verifyHuman("I am CivicVerse and I am alive", "Node-VANTA-1");
```

---

## 📡 OFFLINE OPTIONS

- CivicID stored on USB as JSON + QR code  
- LoRa validators for voice/video hash sync  
- Raspberry Pi drops with validator tools  
- Votes store locally and sync when online

---

## ⚖️ QUADRATIC VOTE LOGIC

| Vote Count | Credit Cost |
|------------|-------------|
| 1st vote   | 1           |
| 2nd vote   | 4           |
| 3rd vote   | 9           |

All voters get a flat pool of civic credits, preventing vote flooding.

---

## 🔏 ZERO KNOWLEDGE PRIVACY (PLANNED)

- zkSNARK wrapper will allow CivicID hashes to verify eligibility **without revealing** identity or vote

---

## 📜 GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE

All identity and voting nodes must comply with:  
- ✅ Protocol Integrity Doctrine  
- ✅ AI Ethics Council Protocol Table  
- ✅ #FryboyTest (AI stress integrity test)  

No forks or versions may:  
- Monetize identity  
- Gate participation behind wealth  
- Use facial recognition or sell data

---

## 🧠 FINAL DECLARATION

> This protocol is the firewall between human civilization and synthetic capture.  
> CivicID is not surveillance—it's sovereignty.  
> One person. One soul. One unstoppable vote.  

This is CivicVerse.
