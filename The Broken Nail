🔧 Executive Summary

The Broken Nail™ is not a beauty salon. It’s a fucking triage station for women and survivors clawing their way through poverty, addiction, probation, domestic abuse, and systemic neglect. It exists at the intersection of:
	•	Job interviews you’re not ready for
	•	Court dates you can’t miss
	•	Rehab you’re not sure you want
	•	And a version of yourself you almost forgot existed

It is where $9.99 buys you a shot at dignity.

🧱 Mission Statement

“We aren’t fixing people. We’re fixing their appearance long enough to survive the next hit of reality.”

The Broken Nail uses street pricing, fast services, and no-judgment vibes to provide beauty and grooming basics to women who’ve been priced out, locked out, or kicked out of traditional care. It’s a pre-job, pre-hearing, pre-rehab glam station for the forgotten class.

👶 Strategic Location Model

The Broken Nail is intentionally placed between:
	•	Tattoo shop: Regret it later ink
	•	Daycare: Bring your kid, get a break, glow up
	•	Probation Office or Check Cashing Spot (target future expansions)

This is a survival ecosystem. Not a mall.

📜 Ethical Framework

The Broken Nail is licensed under CivicVerse’s Dignity-Based Street Enterprise Model, meaning:
	•	No exploitation of employees or customers
	•	Sliding scale services based on risk, not income
	•	All staff trained in trauma-response customer care
	•	Trans women welcome, no questions asked

⸻

💰 Economic Engine

Primary Revenue Sources:
	•	Direct service ($9.99+ tiers)
	•	CivicVerse-backed community microgrants
	•	Bar service margin
	•	Cross-referrals from partner programs (rehab, housing, legal aid)

Future Revenue Options:
	•	Mobile Broken Nail vans for shelters & encampments
	•	Franchise to other “probation plaza” zones
	•	CivicToken integration for reputation-based discounts

🛡 Strategic Impact

The Broken Nail isn’t trying to fix poverty—it’s making it survivable, one hair fluff at a time. When systems fail, dignity becomes currency. We make that affordable.
	•	Helps women pass interviews, hearings, child services, and self-checks
	•	Replaces humiliation with humor
	•	Builds community around visibility, not invisibility
	•	Restores a small, vital piece of identity: “Damn… I don’t look like shit anymore.”
