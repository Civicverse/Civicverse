## 🚀 Overview

**Civicverse** is an **extremely conceptual**, decentralized, non-custodial, modular, **civilian-owned and governed civic metaverse** designed to be:

- 📴 Offline-first  
- 🧱 Resilient  
- 🕰️ Long-lived  

Civicverse is **software infrastructure**, **not**:
- a platform operator  
- a financial intermediary  
- a marketplace owner  
- a casino  
- an employer  
- a custodian  

It is built to **outlast legacy systems rather than replace them**, acting as a **neutral civic firewall and routing layer** through which institutions, commerce, labor, media, and value can pass — while **structurally returning value to civilians**.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- 🔐 Non-custodial by design  
- 🔁 Peer-to-peer value flows only  
- ✍️ Explicit opt-in via Terms of Service  
- ⚙️ Protocol-enforced rules, not discretionary admins  
- 📴 Offline-first civilian data ownership  
- 🗳️ One person, one vote governance  
- 🏛️ Institution-compatible and non-adversarial  
- 🌱 Civilian ownership of infrastructure  
- 🪙 Crypto used for real economic utility  

---

## 🆔 Identity

- Users generate and control a **decentralized identity locally**  
- Keys generated **client-side or offline**  
- ❌ No platform custody  
- ❌ No recovery, freezes, reversals, or overrides  
- ⚠️ Loss of keys equals loss of access  

**Identity is portable across:**
- 🌍 Worlds  
- 🎮 Games  
- 🛒 Markets  
- 🛠️ Jobs  
- 🗳️ Governance  

Civicverse does **not** issue, own, revoke, or control identities.

---

## 💸 Payments, Value Flow & Custody

- **All payments, payouts, trades, and rewards occur off-platform**  
- Value moves **directly between users**, peer-to-peer  

Civicverse **never**:
- Custodies funds  
- Holds wallets  
- Escrows payments  
- Processes transactions  
- Sets prices, odds, or payouts  
- Acts as a settlement or clearing layer  

---

## 🤖 AI Governance Coordination

- Off-platform value flows are **coordinated, validated, and rule-enforced** by **AI governance logic**  
- Participation is **explicitly opt-in via the Terms of Service**  

**AI governance layer capabilities:**
- Enforces user-consented rules  
- Applies protocol-defined constraints  
- Triggers verification and compliance checks  
- Routes protocol-defined micro-fees  

> The AI governance layer **does not custody or move funds**.  
> It operates purely as **rule enforcement and coordination infrastructure**.

---

## 🪙 Currency

**Primary transactional currency:** **Monero**

- 🔒 Private  
- 🔄 Fungible  
- 🤝 Peer-to-peer by default  

Civicverse does **not** issue, mint, back, or control any currency.

---

## 🧾 Opt-In Civic Micro-Tax

- **1% opt-in civic micro-tax**, consented to via Terms of Service  
- Enforced at the **protocol and AI governance layer**  

**Applies to:**
- In-ecosystem economic activity  
- Off-platform payouts from Civicverse-coordinated activity  
- Skill-based gaming payouts  
- P2P gambling payouts  
- Job payments  
- Local marketplace transactions  
- In-game and real-world commerce  

**Routing:**
- Routed **directly** to a **community-governed, non-custodial treasury**  
- Civicverse never receives, holds, or controls funds
