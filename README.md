Civicverse

Decentralized • Non-Custodial • Offline-First • Civilian-Owned Infrastructure

Overview

Civicverse is considered an extremley conceptual decentralized, non-custodial, modular, civilian-owned and governed civic metaverse designed to be offline-first, resilient, and long-lived.

Civicverse is software infrastructure, not a platform operator, financial intermediary, marketplace owner, casino, employer, or custodian.

It is built to outlast legacy systems rather than replace them, acting as a neutral civic firewall and routing layer through which institutions, commerce, labor, media, and value can pass — while structurally returning value to civilians.

Core Principles

Non-custodial by design

Peer-to-peer value flows only

Explicit opt-in participation via Terms of Service

Protocol-enforced rules, not discretionary admins

Offline-first civilian data ownership

One person, one vote governance

Institution-compatible and non-adversarial

Civilian ownership of infrastructure

Crypto used for real economic utility

Identity

Users generate and control a decentralized identity locally

Keys are generated client-side or offline

No platform custody

No recovery, freezes, reversals, or admin overrides

Loss of keys equals loss of access

Identity is portable across:

Worlds

Games

Markets

Jobs

Governance

Civicverse does not issue, own, revoke, or control identities.

Payments, Value Flow, and Custody

All payments, payouts, trades, and rewards occur off-platform

Value moves directly between users, peer-to-peer

Civicverse never:

Custodies funds

Holds wallets

Escrows payments

Processes transactions

Sets prices, odds, or payouts

Acts as a settlement or clearing layer

AI Governance Coordination

Off-platform value flows are coordinated, validated, and rule-enforced by AI governance logic

Participation in this governance logic is explicitly opt-in via the Terms of Service

The AI governance layer:

Enforces user-consented rules

Applies protocol-defined constraints

Triggers verification and compliance checks

Routes protocol-defined micro-fees

The AI governance layer does not custody or move funds. It operates purely as rule enforcement and coordination infrastructure.

Currency

Primary transactional currency: Monero

Private

Fungible

Peer-to-peer by default

Civicverse does not issue, mint, back, or control any currency.

Opt-In Civic Micro-Tax

1% opt-in civic micro-tax, consented to via the Terms of Service

Enforced at the protocol and AI governance layer

Applies to:

In-ecosystem economic activity

Off-platform payouts resulting from Civicverse-coordinated activity

Skill-based gaming payouts

P2P gambling payouts

Job payments

Local marketplace transactions

In-game and real-world commerce

Routing

The 1% micro-tax is routed directly to a community-governed, non-custodial treasury

Civicverse never receives, holds, or controls these funds

Community Treasury

Fully non-custodial

Governed by one-person-one-vote mechanisms

Transparent allocation rules

Funds may be used for:

Energy infrastructure

Data and compute infrastructure

Mining operations

Public goods

Maintenance and expansion

Long-term civilian dividends and UBI (subject to vote)

Community Mining & Self-Funding
Distributed Mining

Civilians may mine:

Monero

Other supported cryptocurrencies

Mining can occur:

At home

On personal rigs

In community-run mining centers

Routing

Mining rewards are protocol-routed directly to the community treasury

No platform custody

No intermediary control

Solar-Powered Infrastructure

Treasury funds are used to build:

Solar-powered mining infrastructure

Off-grid energy systems

Community data and compute centers

These facilities are:

Civilian-owned

Community-governed

Locally deployed

They may also support employment, training, and housing-linked programs, including employing and housing homeless individuals.

Economic Flywheel

Peer-to-peer economic activity occurs off-platform

AI governance enforces user-consented rules

1% civic micro-tax routes to the treasury

Community mining adds continuous funding

Treasury builds energy and compute infrastructure

Infrastructure lowers costs and increases resilience

Surplus funds public goods

Long-term outcome: civilian-governed UBI

Governance

One person, one vote

Opt-in participation

Governance covers:

Rule proposals

Treasury allocation

Infrastructure priorities

AI enforcement standards

Enforcement

AI-assisted rule enforcement

Human oversight

No centralized discretionary authority

Metaverse & Main Game
