🌐 CivicVerse Starter Node

Post-Collapse Governance | AI Ethics | Community Mining | The Fryboy Test

Build your own self-sovereign, ethical, decentralized civic node from scratch.

🧭 What Is CivicVerse?

CivicVerse is a survival protocol — a decentralized civic operating system designed to replace broken systems and rebuild communities with trust, transparency, and aligned AI.

This starter node is a bare minimum reference implementation to launch your own local CivicVerse node with:

Community mining to incentivize participation
AI ethics enforcement through the Fryboy Test
Basic governance with transparent voting
Minimal identity onboarding
It is intentionally simple, modular, and extendable.

🏗️ Why Build This?

Governments are broken, corporations control AI, and surveillance is default.
CivicVerse is a blueprint to reclaim power for communities with ethical AI and self-governance.
This starter node is your first step — fork, build, deploy, and grow your own civic community.
