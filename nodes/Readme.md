# 🌐 CivicVerse Starter Node

### Post-Collapse Governance | AI Ethics | Community Mining | The Fryboy Test  
**Build your own self-sovereign, ethical, decentralized civic node from scratch.**

---

## 🧭 What Is CivicVerse?

CivicVerse is a **survival protocol** — a decentralized civic operating system designed to **replace broken systems** and rebuild communities with **trust, transparency, and aligned AI**.

This starter node is a **bare minimum reference implementation** to launch your own local CivicVerse node with:

- Community mining to incentivize participation  
- AI ethics enforcement through the Fryboy Test  
- Basic governance with transparent voting  
- Minimal identity onboarding  

It is intentionally **simple, modular, and extendable**.

---

## 🏗️ Why Build This?

- Governments are broken, corporations control AI, and surveillance is default.  
- CivicVerse is a blueprint to reclaim power for communities with **ethical AI** and **self-governance**.  
- This starter node is your **first step** — fork, build, deploy, and **grow your own civic ecosystem.**

## 🛠️ Core Features

### 1. Community Mining  
A barebones mining system rewards participants over time.  
- Mining sessions tracked by ID  
- Rewards accrue as a function of time spent mining  
- Incentivizes continuous participation and onboarding  

### 2. AI Ethics & The Fryboy Test  
- Basic heuristic checks for unethical content  
- Simulates AI alignment validation  
- Integrate with real AI APIs later for automated ethical audits  

### 3. Governance Voting  
- Submit and tally votes on proposals  
- In-memory vote storage (replace with blockchain in production)  
- Supports “yes”/“no” voting now, extensible to ranked or quadratic  

### 4. Identity & Onboarding  
- Minimal identity verification placeholder  
- Easily expandable with zero-knowledge proofs or world ID tech

## 📦 Backend Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

	2.	Run the API server

uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Frontend Setup
	1.	Install dependencies

cd frontend
npm install

	2.	Start the React dev server

npm start

3.	Access the UI

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000
The frontend connects to the backend API on port 8000.

🧪 How It Works

Identity

User submits minimal proof of personhood (user ID or token).
This can be extended with zero-knowledge proofs or third-party identity providers.

Mining

Users start a mining session that rewards them with tokens proportional to session duration.
This incentivizes continuous participation and onboarding activity.

Governance

Users vote on proposals via API calls.
Votes are currently stored in-memory but designed to be replaced by blockchain-backed ledger.

AI Ethics & Fryboy Test

Submitted texts run through a simple heuristic Fryboy Test for unethical keywords and alignment risks.
In production, integrate with AI models for real-time ethics validation.

🧩 Extending the Starter Node

This repo is a foundation. To build a production-ready CivicVerse node:
	•	Replace in-memory vote storage with blockchain (Monero, Kaspa, or Ethereum)
	•	Integrate real AI APIs for ethical checks (ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek)
	•	Implement privacy-preserving identity proofs (ZK-SNARKs, World ID)
	•	Add mesh networking and offline deployment support
	•	Develop frontends for mobile and offline access
	•	Package as a bootable USB or Raspberry Pi image for field deployment

⸻

🔐 Protocol Integrity & Ethics

Every deployed node must:
	•	Pass the Protocol Integrity Doctrine
	•	Run AI through the Fryboy Test and log results
	•	Maintain transparency and auditability of all governance votes
	•	Protect citizens’ rights and privacy

⸻

🚀 Roadmap & Calls to Action
	•	Fork this repo, build your node
	•	Deploy locally or in communities you trust
	•	Share learnings, improvements, and forks
	•	Join the global CivicVerse movement to scale ethical self-governance

💬 Final Word

CivicVerse isn’t a product.
It’s a promise — a covenant between freedom and technology,
between community and AI,
between ethics and survival.

You don’t need permission to build this.
You just need purpose.
